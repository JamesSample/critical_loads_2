Connecting to PostGIS running on GCP

1. From the gcloud shell, set the project and authenticate

		gcloud config set project nivaprod-1
		
		gcloud container clusters get-credentials niva-prod-cluster
	
2. To establish a "dev" connection via gcloud, you can forward port 5432 of the pod/container
   to any unused port on your local PC
   
		kubectl port-forward podname 25432:5432
		
   Once this is running, you can connect to the database from another shell (or from Python or
   pgAdmin). To get the credentials for the db, run
   
		kubectl exec podname env | FINDSTR POSTGRES
		
   before forwarding the ports. This will give you all the details you need to connect. Note that 
   this approach is 'temporary'. Once the container is properly exposed on GCP, it should be 
   possible to connect directly (i.e. without port forwarding).
